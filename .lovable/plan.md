## Plan: Integrate Glassmorphism Trust Hero Component

### What we're building
A stunning glassmorphism-style hero section with animated stats, a client marquee, and call-to-action buttons. This will replace the current blank landing page.

### Steps

1. **Add the hero component** — Copy `glassmorphism-trust-hero.tsx` into `src/components/ui/` with the full glassmorphism card, marquee, stats, and CTA buttons.

2. **Replace the background image** — Swap the Supabase-hosted background image URL with a reliable Unsplash stock image (dark abstract/gradient).

3. **Update the Index page** — Replace the current placeholder content with the `HeroSection` component, wrapped in the dark background container as shown in the demo.

No new dependencies are needed — `lucide-react` and all other requirements are already installed.
